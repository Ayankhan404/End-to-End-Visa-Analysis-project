Visa Prediction & Analysis - End-to-End Machine Learning Or Data Science Project

🚀 Project Overview

The Visa Prediction & Analysis project is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict whether a visa application will be certified or not based on various features like education, job experience, employer details, and wage information.

This project follows a structured ML pipeline, including:
✔️ Data Understanding & Preprocessing
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Feature Engineering
✔️ Model Building & Evaluation
✔️ Model Deployment (if applicable)

By using supervised learning algorithms, we evaluate different models to determine the best-performing classifier for visa approval prediction.

📊 Step 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing

The dataset contains 25,480 rows and 12 features, including:

case_id → Unique identifier (removed during preprocessing)

continent → Continent of employment

education → Employee’s education level

has_job_experience → Previous job experience (Yes/No)

requires_job_training → Whether job training is required (Yes/No)

number_of_employees → Employer's company size

year_of_establishment → When the employer was established

region_of_employment → Employment region

prevailing_wage_unit → Salary unit (Hourly/Yearly)

full_time_position → Full-time job or not

case_status → Target variable (Certified / Not Certified)

✅ Data Cleaning & Processing Steps:
✔ Checked for null values (None found)
✔ Separated categorical & numerical features
✔ Dropped case_id (irrelevant to predictions)
✔ Analyzed value distributions

🔍 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps understand the relationships between features and detect patterns in the dataset.

✅ Univariate Analysis:

Visualized numerical features (Histogram, Boxplot)

Found skewness & outliers in numerical data

✅ Multivariate Analysis:

Used correlation heatmaps to check feature relationships

Found no strong correlation between numerical features

Used Chi-Square Test to analyze categorical relationships

Identified that "requires_job_training" is independent and may not contribute significantly

✅ Case Status Insights:

66.79% of applications were certified

33.21% were not certified

Used groupby analysis to understand trends in approvals and rejections

🛠 Step 3: Feature Engineering

To improve model performance, we applied various feature engineering techniques:

✔️ Outlier Handling:

Used Quantile Capping & Trimming to handle extreme values

✔️ Categorical Encoding:

Applied Label Encoding for binary categorical features

Used One-Hot Encoding for multi-category features

✔️ Handling Imbalanced Data:

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset

🤖 Step 4: Model Building & Evaluation

We tested multiple models and compared their performances:✅ Steps Taken for Model Training:
✔ Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
✔ Used train-test split to divide data into training & testing sets
✔ Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
✔ Evaluated models using Accuracy Score & Cross-Validation

📌 Key Findings:

Random Forest performed the best accuracy

SVM also performed well, but was computationally expensive

Logistic Regression had lower accuracy, making it less suitable
